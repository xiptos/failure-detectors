 * Implementation of an eventually perfect failure detector.

 * This failure detector initially suspects no processes. A process becomes a suspect when no message has been received
 * from it within a timeout period that gets updated with each received message (does not have to be heartbeat).
 * The strategy and default values for these timeouts are a responsibility of {@link detector.timeout.TimeoutStrategy}.
 * <p/>
 * A suspect process can become un-suspected when a message from that process arrives.
 * <p/>
 * This class is thread-safe.
